AXES home user interface
========================

Client and server-side code for AXES home.

.. image :: https://bitbucket.org/kevinmcguinness/axes-home/raw/master/doc/screenshots/search1-ipad.png

This is the front end to the `AXES <http://www.axes-project.eu/>`_ home system.
This software was developed as part of the `AXES EU FP7 project
<http://www.axes-project.eu/>`_. This front end needs to be used in conjunction
with the `link management and search system
<https://bitbucket.org/alyr/limas>`_ developed by AXES. This software is
licensed under the Apache 2 license.

Dependencies
------------

Server-side:

* `MongoDB <http://www.mongodb.org>`_
* `pymongo <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_
* `flask <http://flask.pocoo.org/>`_
* `flask-restful <http://flask-restful.readthedocs.org/>`_
* `jsonrpclib <https://github.com/joshmarshall/jsonrpclib>`_
* `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org>`_ for deployment.

Install Python dependencies with::

  $ cd server
  $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You can also use a Python `virtual environment
<http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org>`_ to install these locally::

  $ virtualenv venv
  $ . ./venv/bin/activate
  (venv) $ cd server
  (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt

You'll need to launch the gunicorn server (see below) with the virtual
environment activated for this to work.


Configuration
-------------

Configure the application by creating a ``settings.cfg`` file that overrides
any settings that you want to change from ``axeshome/settings.py``. A template
settings file ``settings.cfg.template`` is provided for reference. The
``settings.cfg`` file is just a standard python file that defines the relevant
variables. Here's an example::

  DEBUG = False

  # LIMAS JSON RPC service
  SERVICE_URL = 'http://<server>:<port>/json-rpc'

  # Location for user media
  MEDIA_URL = '/axes/home/media/'
  MEDIA_PATH = '/home/axes/servers/wp7/axes-home/client/media/'


The media path is where the server will store user uploaded images. The media
URL is the corresponding URL where this media can be accessed via HTTP. Other
settings can also be configured: see ``axeshome/settings.py``.
  
You can tell the application where to find the settings file by setting the
environment variable ``AXESHOME_SETTINGS``::

  $ export AXESHOME_SETTINGS=settings.cfg
  
  
Installation
------------

In the following, I assume you have `nginx <http://nginx.org>`_ installed and
that MongoDB is installed and running. If you must use Apache instead of nginx
then something similar can be achieved using `mod_proxy
<http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_proxy.html>`_ and the Alias
directive (see: `here <http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/urlmapping.html>`_).

Add a section to your ``nginx.conf`` to for hosting the static client code. The
following will map URLs starting with ``/axes/home`` to static files in
``/home/axes/servers/wp7/axes-home/client``::

  # AXES home client side 
  location /axes/home {
      rewrite ^/axes/home$ /axes/home/ permanent;
      rewrite ^/axes/home(.*)$ $1 break;
      root /home/axes/servers/wp7/axes-home/client;
      index /axes/home/index.html;
  }

Add a section to your ``nginx.conf`` to so that requests to ``/axes/home/api``
are passed to the flask server. The following assumes the flask server will run
on port 5002::

  # AXES home server side
  location /axes/home/api/ {
      rewrite ^/axes/home/api(.*)$ $1 break;
      proxy_pass http://localhost:5002/axes/home/api;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
      client_max_body_size 50M;
  }

Restart nginx or tell it to reload the changes::

  $ nginx -s reload
  
Run the flask server with gunicorn. For example, the following command runs the
server in debug mode::

  $ cd server
  $ gunicorn axeshome:app --debug --log-level DEBUG --bind :5002

You'll probably want to use `supervisor <http://supervisord.org>`_ to start and
stop the the gunicorn process in production. You can just use a screen
session to keep it alive in development.


Notes
-----

If the video files are being hosted on a different server or port than the UI,
then they will need to be proxied locally for similarity search using an
arbitrary video frame to work. This is due to browser security policies on
accessing image pixel data from untrusted sources.

The following example shows how to setup a local proxy in nginx from
``/collections/`` to ``http://<server>/collections/``::

  location /collections/ {
      proxy_pass http://<server>;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Protocol $scheme;
  }
  
Depending on how limas is setup, you may also need to rewrite some of the
returned URLs to point them to the proxied source. This can be achieved by
adding something like the following to you ``settings.cfg``::

  # Rules for transforming responses from limas
  LIMAS_RESPONSE_POSTPROCESSING_RULES = {
      'videoSources.url': [
          (r'^http://<server>/collections(.*)$', 
           r'/collections\1')
      ]
  }

The above tells the response post-processor to process key paths ending with
``videoSources.url`` with the given list of rules. Each rule is a pair, the
first containing a regular expression to match, and the second containing the
replacement to use if the regular expression matches. The patterns are
processed by Python's `re.sub
<https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html#re.sub>`_ function, so the same
rules apply.


Development
-----------

You can use the ``server/run.py`` script to launch a flask development server
during development. The following runs a debug server on port 5002::

  $ cd server
  $ ./run.py 5002

You'll need a slightly different nginx.conf in development mode because
gunicorn treats the ``SCRIPT_NAME`` header a little differently. Use the
following in the server side setup::

  proxy_pass http://localhost:5002/;
  
If you change any ``.scss`` files in the client-side code, you'll need to
recompile the css with `sass <http://sass-lang.com>`_. Assuming you have sass
installed, you can recompile the css with the following::

  $ cd client
  $ sass sass/index.scss css/index.css
